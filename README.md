# RuneTask

RuneTask is a simple, users-friendly to-do list web app built with Django. Users can create, manage and track their goals with the option to link their current runescape character details in order to keep track of their goals. This project was created as part of my Code Institute 16 week bootcamp course. The aim is to use the Django framework to create a full-stack project which is hosted on Heroku. There must be a custom database table and the app must provide some CRUD functionality.
